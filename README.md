## Gamepad

This project allows you to control your [DeckDeckGo] presentation with a Gamepad. Under the hood, it relies on [@gamepad/core](https://github.com/natemoo-re/gamepad), a wrapper around the Web's [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API). Currently, it supports Nintendo's [Joy-Con](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy-Con), but if you'd like to see support for your favorite controller, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/natemoo-re/gamepad/issues) on the Gamepad repository.
